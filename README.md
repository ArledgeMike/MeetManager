<p>MeetManager is a Ruby Command Line CRUD application. Create a list of tasks for your day. Mark tasks complete as you go through your day. When you are finished with a task just delete and move on. If you need to take Meet Manager with you just print out your list to a text file and drop it on your phone. All this in one spot.
